# Library-Management

Designed and developed “LibraLogix,” a comprehensive library management system using Java, focusing on efficient management of book inventory and user transactions. The system is implemented with advanced object-oriented programming techniques to handle real-world library operations such as book checkouts, returns, renewals, and fines. Utilizing a dynamic cataloging system, it enables precise tracking and management of books by title, author, and category, enhancing the user’s ability to quickly locate and manage resources.

The system also integrates user account management, supporting permissions, and transaction histories, which facilitates a personalized and secure user experience. The implementation of a serialized file system for account data storage ensures data persistence across sessions. This project highlights the utility of Java in developing robust applications that require handling complex data structures and providing real-time user feedback and interaction. The library system serves as a model for scalable software architecture, potentially adaptable to larger scale digital library systems or integrated into existing educational institution management software.
